The up and coming podcast started as most podcasts do — some friends getting together and recording the adventures. PSSAfterHours is different than most, as they also video themselves during the podcast for a videocast and they do it on Facebook Live! Be sure you go join the fun. If you miss a live recording, don’t worry! They upload to their YouTube channel as well.

Thacker Broadcasting is proud to be named the distributor for their audio channels. Join the clan of LT, Rod, and Zeke every Wednesday for the new adventures they experience with the paranormal world!
