        year: "2019"
        desc: "Local radio stations were all owned by one media conglomerate. Because of this, ads were out of control. The community complained, but no changes came. The radio shows were bland; no one wanted to listen to those stations. They wanted something new. The idea for Thacker Broadcasting was born. We began working behind the scenes to make it happen."

        year: "April 2021"
        desc: "We officially hit the market as a single member-owned LLC and began marketing our online versions of the stations we planned to build. We did this to test our market demographic to see what they best responded to. While we plan to build more station, we had to start with one and expand from there. Our stations marketing rock, country, and non-mainstream pop were the most popular, and they were combined into what is now known as [Z96 The Mix](https://z96mix.com)."

        desc: "Keeping the company small was hard, especially since we have a lot of ideas that we simply didn't offer for sale. Introducing our web design section. Intially being hired as a consultant for a startup tea company, we've since began to specialize in sites that are quick to load, easy to maintain, and a breeze to use. Because of this, we've changed web hosting platforms more than most, but have since settled on utilizing GitHub via Azure."

        year: "January 2023"
        desc: "Our radio station was performing beautifully, but didn't have the flexibility we needed or wanted. A search began, and we found a platform that allowed us to host it the way we wanted while also giving the flexibility we desired for users. A massive overhaul began of Z96, expanding to encompase a second station we were testing, 98.9 The Elk. Because of this change, we began to offer localized services to businesses for in-store music that they had control over."
