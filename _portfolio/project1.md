The internet radio sensation had no idea what it was doing when it graced the internet on January 2, 2022.

Finding the radio market too saturated with ads, Z96 started out as a rival to local radio stations after complaints. Z96 doesn't have any ads, and that's thanks to the supporters of our station. By keeping the station ad-free, you can listen to more of the music you love.

The station started out simple: a laptop and some streaming software, and ran intermittently throughout most of 2022. It finally found a permanent home inside of Thacker Broadcasting's clientele. Now Z96 Mix runs on state-of-the-art hardware with software to match! With a request system, you can listen to your favorite music anytime you click! While some hiccups have happened, Z96 has been running uninterrupted since October 2022.

This has allowed Z96 to expand in its listener-base, which allows for room to improve. These improvements have included a more dynamic system for imaging and songs, along with a more robust broadcast system. Another is a physical station to take on the local rivals that started the station.
