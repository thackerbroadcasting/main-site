The mildly-popular podcast started out as a complete accident, and was not expected to become a podcast that could be found on the front page of Comedy categories during the summer and fall of 2020.

Created in the winter of 2018, the podcast didn’t gain traction until a new face was given in 2020. A new ensemble of members, in addition to a new editing style, helped contribute to the podcasts’ success during a time when humor was craved.

Episodes were recorded through Discord, and edited during the ensemble’s free time, the podcast began seeing some of its best traffic since its inception.

Episodes were initially released on a weekly schedule, but have since slipped back to a monthly schedule.
